# AI Session Log (append-only)

**Audience: AI agents.** Every Claude Code (or other AI) session that changes this repo
MUST append an entry here before committing. Never edit or delete old entries.
Newest entries at the TOP (below this header block).

**Entry template:**
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line task summary>
- **Task:** what the user asked for
- **Changes:** files touched + what was done in each
- **Decisions:** non-obvious choices made and why
- **Gotchas / learnings:** anything a future agent should know (stale docs found,
  traps hit, prod quirks) — also promote durable ones into CLAUDE.md
- **Verification:** what was run (npm test / build / manual) and the result
- **Left undone / follow-ups:** anything pending
```

## 2026-07-09 — Add CI (GitHub Actions)
- **Task:** Set up CI/CD — the repo had none (only a local pre-commit hook + a Vercel cron).
- **Changes:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`
  on push to main + every PR. Node 20, npm cache, placeholder public env for a deterministic build.
  `.eslintrc.json` — new; extends `next/core-web-vitals`.
- **Decisions:** build step gets placeholder `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env — the Supabase
  clients no-op without real values, so the build never touches prod. There was **no committed
  ESLint config**, so `next lint` prompted interactively and would hang in CI (earlier "lint clean"
  signals were the RTK proxy fabricating output). Disabled `react/no-unescaped-entities` (cosmetic,
  ~15 false-positives on English apostrophes); kept `exhaustive-deps` + `no-img-element` as warnings.
- **Verification:** real `next lint` → 0 errors, exit 0; `npm test` 356 pass; `next build` exit 0.
- **Left undone / follow-ups:** could add Playwright e2e as a separate job later (needs a test DB).
  This eslintrc must land on main (via this PR) for the other PRs' CI to lint cleanly.

## 2026-07-05 — Set up AI documentation system
- **Task:** Make the repo self-documenting for AI work: doc-update protocol enforced
  before every commit, human changelog, AI session log, current-state file,
  directory-level CLAUDE.md files.
- **Changes:**
  - `CLAUDE.md` — added mandatory "Documentation Protocol" section + doc map at top;
    fixed stale Frontend Architecture (real shell is `app/(tabs)/layout.jsx` +
    `lib/BettingContext.jsx`; `components/AdeYaarApp.jsx` is dead code); updated file
    layout (route group, new modals, lib files, migrations now 001–033); added failure
    modes #10 (missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` on Vercel) and #11 (AdeYaarApp dead
    code); updated feature checklist.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — new, human-readable, with reconstructed recent history.
  - `docs/ai/SESSION_LOG.md` — this file.
  - `docs/ai/STATE.md` — new, current system state snapshot.
  - `app/api/CLAUDE.md`, `components/CLAUDE.md`, `lib/CLAUDE.md` — new directory-level
    references (Claude Code auto-loads these when working in those dirs).
- **Decisions:** Kept `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PLAN.md` as-is (marked as
  possibly-lagging in the doc map; root CLAUDE.md wins on conflict). Did not put any
  credentials in repo docs. Nothing committed — user asked for changes only.
- **Gotchas / learnings:** Root CLAUDE.md had significantly drifted: it described the
  pre-refactor AdeYaarApp architecture. Tournament is mid-knockout stage (migrations
  through 033, R32/QF features live).
- **Verification:** Docs-only change; no build/test needed.
- **Left undone / follow-ups:** User to review and commit. Consider a pre-commit hook
  or `.claude/settings` hook to hard-enforce the doc protocol.
